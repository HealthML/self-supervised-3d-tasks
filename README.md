## Overview

This codebase contains a implementation of five self-supervised representation learning
techniques, utility code for running training and evaluation loops.

## Usage instructions

In this codebase we provide configurations for training/evaluation of our models.

For debugging or running small experiments we support training and evaluation using a single GPU device.

### Preparing data

Our implementations of the algorithms require the data to be squared for 2D or cubic for 3D images.

### Clone the repository and install dependencies

Make sure you have [anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) installed.

Then perform the following commands, while you are in your desired workspace directory:
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/HealthML/self-supervised-3d-tasks.git
cd self-supervised-3d-tasks
conda env create -f env_all_platforms.yml
conda activate conda-env
pip install -e .
```

### Running the experiments
To train any of the self-supervised tasks with a specific algorithm, run `python train.py self_supervised_3d_tasks/configs/train/{algorithm}_{dimension}.json`
To run the downstream task and initialize the weights from a pretrained checkpoint, run `python finetune.py self_supervised_3d_tasks/configs/finetune/{algorithm}_{dimension}.json`

### Setting the configs

In the two example configs below, the respective parameters for training and testing configs are explained.
